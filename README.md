# OnYourWay

This is the GitHub repository for the collaborative route managing web-app. This was created by Jesse Hughes, Nick Hughes, Aaron Joyce, Dalton Lobosky, and Jason Beard for Missouri S&T's Intro to Software Engineering course. 

## Installation

In order to run this web-app, it must be run upon a Laravel Homestead webserver. A custom version of this that automatically pulls this project and runs it locally has been created. This can be found at:
